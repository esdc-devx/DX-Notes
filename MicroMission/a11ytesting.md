# Accessibility (A11y) Test Automation Micromission

The Developer Experience Team is looking for someone to help us move closer to Continuous Delivery.

We need someone who is willing to do some research and build a Proof of Concept to show that we can do some sort of automated a11y testing with our current infrastructure.

Anything you build will be Open Source and shared with the public so this is a great way to learn how to work in the open, however what would be even better is if you can find an open source solution that will do everything with no extra development needed.

This POC will be required to do the following:

Navigate to all pages of a web hosted application.
Run an accessibility scan on those pages.
Report the results of that scan as structured data to be consumed by other systems.

At the moment we are looking at tools like Lighthouse CLI, AAAT, and the like but are open to any that will work here.
