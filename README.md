# Developer Experience Team

## Mission Statement
Improving the Developer Experience at ESDC through building a culture of Continuous Delivery.

## Principles

- Put Developers First
- Work in the Open
- Make it Easy to do the Right Things
- Make it Hard to do the Wrong Things
- Don't be Dogmatic in our Decisions
- Small Projects - Big Wins

## Goals
- Modernizing the development process though
  - Encouraging the use of modern development tools
  - Encouraging modern development practices
- Use data to measure performance so we can analyse the effect of changes
- Automate the gathering and exposing of application performance data to encourage more robust applications
- Creating a culture of collaboration in IITB

## Strategy [WIP]

Use Dashboards to measure progress over time as well as to provide instant feedback to developers to allow spontaneous learning opportunites.

Put in place enterprise wide systems (ex: Secret Management, Dependency Managment, etc...) that enables developers to increase the quality of their systems without expending a great deal of effort. These systems should be audited against ITSG-33 Compliance controls so that just by using these tools systems are compliant thus reducing the compliance burden of teams and increasing the compliance posture of the organization as a whole. 

Demonstrating and providing a path to automate processes.

Pick tools that are simple, modular, composable, and allow interaction through codification (APIs, Configuration as Code). This will allow us to combine them in novel ways and build the best possible solution for each unique problem. This will also enable us to replace tools in these systems as tools and technologies improve over time. What is the best tool for the job now may not be the best tool for the job in the future.  

Work in the open and in collaboration with Developers at IITB in order to encourage collaboration, enable agency, and foster a feeling of ownership in the improvemenmt of the organization.

Ensure that developers are advocated at every level of decision making in IITB.
